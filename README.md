# jotted

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Our community is on a mission to turn the internet into an accessible, online university by curating the best digital resources already online into structured learning pathways (or courses)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

However most our our api work is done in the `/utils/api.js`

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Do testing on the code to ensure you haven't introduced breaking changes
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Fundamental Principles

1. Separation of Concerns: This principle states that each component in an application should be built independently and be responsible for a single purpose. This makes it easier to debug and maintain the codebase since each component can be tested separately.

2. Modularity: Modularity is the idea of breaking down an application into smaller, reusable components. This helps reduce code duplication and makes it easier to extend applications.

3. Performance: Performance is an important part of any web application. By using Next.js, developers can take advantage of features such as server-side rendering, code splitting, and lazy loading to ensure that the application is running as efficiently as possible.

4. Security: Security is always a top priority when developing web applications. Next.js provides features such as secure cookies, authentication strategies, and authorization schemes to ensure that your application is secure.

5. Scalability: Scalability is the ability of an application to handle increasing amounts of load. Next.js provides features such as server-side rendering, code splitting, and lazy loading to ensure that your application can scale seamlessly.
